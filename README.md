# LoggingWithoutTheBulls61t

This repository is made to be a one stop shop for the security community. The goal is not to fill your SIEMs with junk but to easily detect adversaries and respond.

Don't have any logging enabled?  
You can start enabling logging using the order below:  
1.Servers  
2.Security devices  
3.Network devices  
4.Server applications  
5.Databases  
6.Applications  
7.Desktops  

While all these logs can't be sent to your log collector because of the volume, you should still enable them on the endpoints for incident response and manual threat hunting, remember that just because you are generating these logs you don't need to collect them.
